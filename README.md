## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a geometric deep learning framework to optimize private equity investment decisions by leveraging relational data between companies, sectors, financial metrics, and market conditions. The goal is to build a model that can identify high-potential investment opportunities and predict their performance over time, helping a private equity fund maximize returns.

## Expressed Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create an advanced investment optimization tool for private equity funds. By utilizing cutting-edge geometric deep learning techniques, this project seeks to:
- Accurately model the complex relationships between various investment entities.
- Predict future performance of potential investments.
- Optimize investment decisions to maximize returns.

## Methods

### Data Collection and Integration
- **Financial Statements**: SEC filings, company reports.
- **Market Data**: Stock prices, trading volumes, market indices.
- **Industry Reports**: Analysis from market research firms.
- **News Articles**: Financial news, press releases.
- **Social Media**: Sentiment analysis from platforms like Twitter, Reddit.

### Graph Construction
- **Dynamic Graph Representation**: Nodes represent companies and edges represent relationships such as ownership, partnerships, and market correlations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate financial metrics, market data, sentiment scores, and industry trends as node and edge features.

### Model Development
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Implement GNN architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and temporal graph networks.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Use attention layers to focus on the most relevant features and relationships.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilize pre-trained models and fine-tune them on the specific dataset.

### Backtesting and Validation
- **Historical Data Backtesting**: Validate the model's predictions using historical data.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and return on investment (ROI).

### Decision Support System
- **Investment Recommendations**: Develop an interface that provides investment recommendations based on the model's predictions.
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Use optimization techniques to create a maintenance schedule that minimizes downtime and maximizes returns.

## Key Points

- **Advanced Data Integration**: Combining structured financial data with unstructured text data to enrich the model's input.
- **Cutting-Edge GNN Models**: Utilizing the latest advancements in geometric deep learning to accurately model relationships and predict investment performance.
- **Dynamic Graphs**: Representing temporal changes and dynamic interactions between investment entities.
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Rigorous backtesting using historical data to ensure model reliability.
- **Actionable Insights**: Providing clear and actionable investment recommendations to maximize returns.
